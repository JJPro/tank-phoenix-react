A description of the game you intend to implement

The GAME we intend to build is a 2-4 players online tank game. It is an exciting game that requires at least 2
players and maximal 4 players to play the game. The player visits the game page and enter the specific 
game name so as to create or join the game. Players are ordered in their timestamp to join the game 
(First in First play). If there are already two players are in the same game, a button saying "ready" can 
be clicked to change the player's status to ready the game. If all players in the game are in "ready" status, 
we show a count down for 3 seconds and then the game will start. After 4 players are in the game, other 
players who join the game will be observers and they can watch the game live show just like in the twitch.tv.
When the game is started, other people who join the game will automatically become observers even when some
player was killed in the game and left.

=================================================================
What players will see on the screen

The screen is divided into 2 parts. One part is the game screen (75% on left), on the top is an instruction
states how to play the game, and below the instruction is the real board for tanks to fight each other. The
another part is a chat room (25% on right), each player can write some texts and send to other players with the
user name (or tank color). In the game board, each player will be assigned a color for its tank, and on the
board, there are some grids that can be shoot to be destroyed and some grids cannot be destroyed so as to act
like some type of pretection for the tank. In advanced version, the player can see how much bullets they left 
and what else weapons they have in the game board screen.

=================================================================
What kind of actions they can take

Once the player is in the game, he/she can type message and send out to other players. When the game is 
started, he/she can use "up" "down" "left" "right" arrow in the keyboard to move the tank (based on the 
direction this tank towards) and press "space" to shot bullets. Each tank can be shoot at most 3 times. The 4th 
time been shoot will cause that player died and a prompt will also be shown. He/she can still watch the rest 
tank fight stream show or he/she can close the web page and join another game. (In advanced version, tank may 
can eat some gifts to increase bullets number or receive some powerful weapons, this can be done if we have 
time. If more powerful weapns exist, player can switch weapon by press "enter", a powerful weapon can kill 
a tank no matter how many they have been shoot by the bullet.)

=================================================================
How a player can win

Tank can stay behind non-able-destroyed wall to get cover or they can shot to the able-destroyed wall to 
make more roads to move. Tank needs to shot to other tanks in order to win. If all other tanks have been 
killed besided your tank, then you win!
